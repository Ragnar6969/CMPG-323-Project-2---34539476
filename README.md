# How to use the API:

You should register a user or an admin by using a valid email and the password sould contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers and a special character.
After registering a user or admin. You should login in with the credentials you just created for the user. When you logged in you will recieve a token. You will need to use this token to access the available methods.

To use the methods you should be an admin. Before using any method you should click on the small lock icon to the right of the method. In the textbox type "Bearer (Your token)" then press enter. (NOTE: the space between bearer and the token)

After you finished all the above steps, you will be able to use the method.

When using a edit or delete method you should enter an existing item, otherwise it will result in an error.
